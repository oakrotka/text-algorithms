# text algorithms
this is a repository mainly consisting of implementations of text algorithms and data structures,
which I made to better learn about them.

main inspirations:
- [dr in≈º. Ciura's lectures](https://github.com/MarcinCiura/AGH-AlgorytmyTekstowe)
- [laboratories from my year](https://github.com/langMonk/text-algorithms-course),
but heavily adjusted to mitigate errors in tasks.
